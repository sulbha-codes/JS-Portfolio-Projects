  LoanLogic - Loan Eligibility Checker
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  About:
  A simple, interactive web app that helps users estimate their loan eligibility 
  based on age, income, credit score, and loan type.

  Instructions:
  1. This HTML file creates a web page where users can check their loan eligibility based on realistic financial rules.
  2. Users provide the following inputs:
     - Loan Type (Home, Car, Personal)
     - Age
     - Monthly Income
     - Credit Score
     - Desired Loan Amount
  
3. On clicking “Check Eligibility,” JavaScript logic (in `script.js`) runs:
      - Validates input values
      - Applies loan-type-specific rules (minimum income, credit score, and limits)
      - Calculates and displays eligibility status
      - Shows applicable interest rate for approved loans
  4. Results dynamically appear inside the <div id="result"> container.
  5. Styling is handled via `style.css` — includes responsive layout and theme transitions.
  6. `script.js` handles:
      - Input validation
      - Eligibility calculation logic
      - Dynamic message generation
      - Dark/Light theme toggle with `localStorage`
  7. All inputs use `type="number"` to ensure valid numeric entry.
  8. The theme toggle button saves user preference for consistent UI.
  9. Page supports full responsiveness via the viewport meta tag.

  📘 Note:
  This app is for **educational and demonstration purposes only**. 
  Loan rates and eligibility criteria are simplified for learning.

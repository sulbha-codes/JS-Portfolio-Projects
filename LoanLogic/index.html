  LoanLogic - Loan Eligibility Checker
  -------------------------------------
  Instructions:
  1. This HTML file creates a web page where users can check their loan eligibility based on realistic financial rules.
  2. Users provide the following inputs:
     - Loan Type (Home, Car, Personal, Education)
     - Age
     - Monthly Income
     - Credit Score
     - Desired Loan Amount
  3. Clicking the "Check Eligibility" button will trigger JavaScript logic (in script.js)
     to calculate and display whether the user is eligible, conditionally approved, or denied.
  4. The app dynamically calculates the expected **interest rate** based on the selected loan type and displays it for approved loans.
  5. The result will be displayed in the div with id="result".
  6. External CSS file (style.css) is linked for styling.
  7. External JavaScript file (script.js) contains all interactive functionality, including:
     - Age, income, and credit score validation
     - Loan eligibility rules per loan type
     - Conditional messages for income or loan amount thresholds
     - Dynamic interest rate display
  8. Input types are set to "number" to ensure only numeric values are entered.
  9. Dark/Light mode is available via the toggle button; preference is saved using localStorage.
 10. Responsive design is supported via the viewport meta tag.
